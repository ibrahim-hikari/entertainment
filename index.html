                Fun

                    Fun is the enjoyment of pleasure, particularly in leisure activities.
                    Fun is an experience often unexpected, informal or purposeless. 
                    It is an enjoyable distraction, diverting the mind and body from any serious task or contributing an extra dimension to it. 
                    Although particularly associated with recreation and play, fun may be encountered during work, social functions, and even seemingly mundane activities of daily living.
                    It may often have little to no logical basis, and opinions on whether an activity is fun may differ from person to person. 
                    A distinction between enjoyment and fun is difficult but possible to articulate, fun being a more spontaneous, playful, or active event. 
                    There are psychological and physiological implications to the experience of fun.
                    Modern Westernized civilizations prioritize fun as an external and sexual aspect
